# Jackson's Awesome Status Bar (jasbr)

This is a status bar I am working on for suckless's dwm.

As time goes on I hope to add more modules and improve options and configurations.

### Why another status bar?
There are a few nice ones that are written in C and bash/shell, ones that probably perform better and have better customizations.
But I wanted to see if I could make one that fit my needs and helped me learn Golang a little bit more for something other than very basic web development.

### Why Golang?
It's really nice with concurrency, and that's something I want to integrate in the future, if I can. So you don't have to do something like wait a minute for your bar to update, or kill it and restart it.

Also like I had said previously, I want to learn more about it.
